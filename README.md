Can we Create a smart resource management system for hospitals that optimizes the use of beds, medical staff, and equipment. The system should use real-time data to predict demand and streamline hospital operations.


# Features

## Real-time Bed Allocation and Monitoring

Track availability and occupancy of beds across wards.
Automatically assign beds to patients based on real-time availability and patient priority (e.g., ICU beds for critical patients).
Notify staff when a bed becomes available.

## Medical Staff Management

Manage staff schedules and track shifts (doctors, nurses, etc.).
Assign staff to patients based on workload, shift times, and specialization.
Track staff availability and ensure optimal coverage during peak hours.

## Equipment Management

Track the availability and usage of medical equipment.
Assign equipment to patients when needed and mark it as "in use" or "under maintenance."
Ensure critical equipment (e.g., ventilators) is prioritized for urgent cases.

## Resource Usage Analytics

Monitor and log the usage of beds, staff, and equipment over time.
Analyze data to determine peak hours or days for demand.
Predict future demand for resources based on historical trends and real-time data (e.g., flu season).

## Demand Prediction and Optimization

Use machine learning or statistical models to predict the demand for resources (beds, staff, equipment).
Optimize hospital operations by balancing supply (resources) with expected demand.
Automatically adjust schedules, assign staff, and reallocate equipment based on predicted needs.

## Patient Flow Optimization

Manage the flow of patients from admission to discharge.
Predict discharge times and ensure that resources (beds, staff, equipment) are available for new patients.
Provide a dashboard for staff to monitor patient status, bed availability, and equipment usage.

## Alerts and Notifications

Real-time alerts for staff when critical resources (e.g., ICU beds) are low or equipment requires maintenance.
Notifications for upcoming shift changes and patient admissions/discharges.

## Admin Dashboard

Overview of all hospital resources, including bed occupancy, staff schedules, and equipment availability.
Insights into real-time hospital capacity and performance.
Access to predictive analytics to forecast future resource needs.

## Advanced Features (Optional)

Integration with IoT Devices: Track beds, equipment, and patient vitals using connected devices for even more accurate real-time data.
Automated Scheduling: Automatically adjust staff schedules and assignments based on predicted demand and staff availability.
Patient Health Monitoring: Integrate with patient monitoring systems to track vitals and predict when critical resources will be needed (e.g., ventilators for patients with respiratory issues).
